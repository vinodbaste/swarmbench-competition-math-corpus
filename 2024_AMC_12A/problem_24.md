## Problem

A $\textit{disphenoid}$ is a tetrahedron whose triangular faces are congruent to one another. What is the least total surface area of a disphenoid whose faces are scalene triangles with integer side lengths?

$\textbf{(A) }\sqrt{3}\qquad\textbf{(B) }3\sqrt{15}\qquad\textbf{(C) }15\qquad\textbf{(D) }15\sqrt{7}\qquad\textbf{(E) }24\sqrt{6}$

## Solution 1 (Definition of disphenoid)

Notice that any scalene $\textit{acute}$ triangle can be the faces of a $\textit{disphenoid}$. (See proof in Solution 2.)

As a result, we simply have to find the smallest area a scalene acute triangle with integer side lengths can take on. This occurs with a $4,5,6$ triangle (notice that if you decrease the value of any of the sides the resulting triangle will either be isosceles, degenerate, or non-acute). For this triangle, the semiperimeter is $\frac{15}{2}$, so by Heron’s Formula:

The surface area is simply four times the area of one of the triangles, or $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }15\sqrt{7}}$.

## Solution 2 (Disphenoid in Box)

Let the side lengths of one face of the disphenoid be $a, b, c$. By the definition of a disphenoid with scalene faces, opposite sides must be the same length. Then the disphenoid can be constructed in a rectangular box with dimensions $p, q, r$ such that $a, b, c$ are the $3$ different diagonal lengths of the faces of the box and no two sides are parallel (someone feel free to insert a diagram). Then we have the system

\[p^2 + q^2 = a^2\]\[p^2 + r^2 = b^2\]\[q^2 + r^2 = c^2\]

for positive integers $a, b, c$ and positive $p, q, r$.

Solving for $p, q, r$, we have

\[p^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2}\]\[q^2 = \frac{a^2 - b^2 + c^2}{2}\]\[r^2 = \frac{-a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2}\]

(Notice that, by law of cosines (or by Pythagorean Inequality), these (parallelepiped box side lengths squared) $p^2, q^2, r^2$ each have the same sign as the cosine of the angle at a vertex of a triangular face of the disphenoid. Since they are squares and so non-negative, every angle is non-obtuse. Further, since they are squares of positive side lengths, every angle is acute. So $a, b, c$ are the side lengths of an $\textit{acute}$ triangle.)

WLOG, let $a < b < c$. For $a<4$, $a^2$ is less than or equal to the gap between squares greater than $a^2$, so all such triangles are non-acute and fail.

The next smallest case works: $4^2 + 5^2 > 6^2$ so $a, b, c = 4, 5, 6$.

Using Heron's Formula, the minimum total surface area of the disphenoid is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }15\sqrt{7}}$.

Bonus: by Heron’s Formula, the area of an $x-1, x, x+1$ triangle is $x \sqrt{3 (x-2)(x+2)}/4 = x \sqrt{3 (x^2-4)}/4$.

## Solution 3 (Volume formula)

Recall the formula for a disphenoid is $72V^2=(-a^2+b^2+c^2)(a^2-b^2+c^2)(a^2+b^2-c^2)$, where $V$ is the volume and $a,b,c$ are the sides of each face. Because $72V^2$ is a positive number, $(-a^2+b^2+c^2)(a^2-b^2+c^2)(a^2+b^2-c^2)$ must also be positive which is enough to rule out $2,3,4$ and etc, leaving us with a $4-5-6$ triangle for a surface area of $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }15\sqrt{7}}$
