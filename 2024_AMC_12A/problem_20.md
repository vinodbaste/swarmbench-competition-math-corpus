## Problem

Points $P$ and $Q$ are chosen uniformly and independently at random on sides $\overline {AB}$ and $\overline{AC},$ respectively, of equilateral triangle $\triangle ABC.$ Which of the following intervals contains the probability that the area of $\triangle APQ$ is less than half the area of $\triangle ABC?$

$\textbf{(A) } \left[\frac 38, \frac 12\right] \qquad \textbf{(B) } \left(\frac 12, \frac 23\right] \qquad \textbf{(C) } \left(\frac 23, \frac 34\right] \qquad \textbf{(D) } \left(\frac 34, \frac 78\right] \qquad \textbf{(E) } \left(\frac 78, 1\right]$

## Solution 1

Let $\overline{AP}=x$ and $\overline{AQ}=y$. Applying the sine formula for a triangle's area, we see that \[[\Delta APQ]=\dfrac12\cdot x\cdot y\sin(\angle PAQ)=\dfrac{xy}2\sin(60^\circ)=\dfrac{\sqrt3}4xy.\]

Without loss of generality, we let $AB=BC=CA=1$, and thus $[\Delta ABC]=\dfrac{\sqrt3}4$; we therefore require $\dfrac{\sqrt3}4xy\le\dfrac12\cdot\dfrac{\sqrt3}4\implies xy\le\dfrac12$ for $0\le x,y\le1$. (Note: You can skip most of this by using triangle area ratios ~A_MatheMagician.)

A quick rough sketch of $y=\dfrac1{2x}$ on the square given by $x,y\in[0,1]$ reveals that the curve intersects the boundaries at $(0.5,1)$ and $(1,0.5)$, and it is actually quite (very) obvious that the area bounded by the inequality $xy\le0.5$ and the aforementioned unit square is more than $\dfrac34$ but less than $\dfrac78$ (cf. the diagram below). Thus, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\left(\dfrac34,\dfrac78\right]}$.

## Solution 2

WLOG let $AB=AC=1$\[\frac{AP \cdot AQ \cdot \sin60}{2} < \frac{1 \cdot 1 \cdot \sin60}{4}\]\[AP \cdot AQ < \frac{1}{2}\] Which we can express as $xy < \frac{1}{2}$.

We follow by graphing the equation $xy < \frac 1 2$ on $x, y \in [0, 1]$, and we follow the same way solution 1 does.

We see that the probability is slightly less than $\frac{7}{8}$ but definitely greater than $\frac{3}{4}$

Thus answer choice $\boxed{\text{(D)} \left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{7}{8} \right]}$

## Solution 3

The actual probability can be found by using calculus, and taking the integral.

$P=\int_{0.5}^{1}{\frac{1}{2x}}dx + 0.5= \frac{\ln2+1}{2}\approx 0.84657$.

Thus, since $\frac 3 4 < 0.84655 < \frac 7 8$, we get $\boxed{\text{(D)} \left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{7}{8} \right]}$ ~lptoggled

Note that if you do not know an approximation for $\ln2$, you can use the following power series formula: \[\ln(1+x)=x-\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}3-\frac{x^4}4+...\] Using this formula to four terms gives the apprximation $\ln2 \approx \frac{19}{24}$, which is good enough to solve the problem.

### Another note

If you're feeling up to it, you can assume that the curve is actually a $90^{\circ}$ sector of a circle with radius $\frac{1}{2}.$ Doing so yields \[P = 1 - \pi\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{4} \approx 0.8037,\] which is clearly within the interval $D$. This is also an under-estimate, since the curve of $\frac{1}{2x}$ is not as steep on the interval $x\in (0.5, 1).$
