## Problem 21
There is a unique ordered triple $(a,k,m)$ of nonnegative integers such that
\[\frac{4^a + 4^{a+k}+4^{a+2k}+\cdots + 4^{a+mk}}{2^a + 2^{a+k} + 2^{a+2k}+ \cdots + 2^{a+mk}} = 964.\]
 What is $a+k+m$?

$\textbf{(A) } 8 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(C)}  10  \qquad  \textbf{(D) } 11 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 12$

## Solution 1
The numerator can be written as $2^{2a} +2^{2a+2k}+...+2^{2a+2mk}$, which is actually a sum of geometric series. This can be expressed as $2^{2a} \cdot \frac{1-2^{2k(m+1)}}{1-2^{2k}}$. The denominator in the same way can be expressed as $2^a \cdot \frac{1-2^{k(m+1)}}{1-2^k}$.

Doing some algebra on the top and bottom we get:

\begin{equation}
2^a \cdot \frac{1+2^{k(m+1)}}{1+2^k} = 964
\end{equation}

The prime factorization of $964$ is $241 \cdot 2^2$.

Equating $2^a = 2^2$, we get $a = 2$.

Next since $241$ is a prime number we equate the second term of the product to $241$.

\begin{equation}
\frac{1+2^{k(m+1)}}{1+2^k} = 241
\end{equation}
Doing some algebra we get, that $2^k(2^{km}-241) = 240$

The closest power of $2$ to $241$ is $256$ which is $2^8$. So setting $km = 8$, we get $2^8-241 = 15$

$2^k(15) = 240$, $2^k = 16$, $k = 4$.

This we know that if $k = 4$, then $4m = 8$, so $m = 2$.

Finally, we conclude that $a = 2$, $m = 2$, and $k = 4$.

$4+2+2 = 8$, so the answer is $\fbox{A}$

Actually when it comes to $2^k(2^{km}-241) = 240$;
we can directly observe the answer by discovering $2^k$ is even and $2^{km}-241$ must be odd. So, the only available divisors of 240 is 16 and 15.
And we can have $m = 2$, and $k = 4$.

## Solution 2(alternative method)
We start from this equation derived in Solution 1:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1+2^{k(m+1)}}{1+2^k} = 241
\end{equation}

Note that $241=256-16+1=16^2-16+1$. Also note that this looks similar to the second term in the Sum of Cubes factorization $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. Specifically, when $a=16$ and $b=1$, the right term is $16^2-16+1$. Thus, $\frac{16^3+1^3}{16+1}=241$. We rewrite: $\frac{1+2^{12}}{1+2^4}=241$

We can then get that $m = 2$ and $k=4$, and proceed as above.
