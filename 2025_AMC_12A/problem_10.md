## Problem

In the figure shown below, major arc $\widehat{AD}$ and minor arc $\widehat{BC}$ have the same center, $O$. Also, $A$ lies between $O$ and $B$, and $D$ lies between $O$ and $C$. Major arc $\widehat{AD}$, minor arc $\widehat{BC}$, and each of the two segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ have length $2\pi$. What is the distance from $O$ to $A$?

## Solution 1 (Simple)

The ratio between the radius and the arc length is constant. For the inner circle, the radius, which we will denote as $r$, has a corresponding arc length of $2\pi r - 2\pi$ (the circumference minus the major arc length). For the outer circle, the radius, which is $r + 2\pi$, has a corresponding arc length of $2\pi$. We therefore write the equation

\[\frac{r}{2\pi r - 2\pi} = \frac{r+2\pi}{2\pi},\] which simplifies to \[r = (r+2\pi)(r-1)\]\[0 = r^2 + (2\pi-2)r - 2\pi.\] Applying the Quadratic Formula, we get that $r =\boxed{\textbf{(B)} 1 - \pi + \sqrt{1 +\pi^2}}$

## Solution 2

Let the length of $OA=r$, which is the radius of the smaller circle. Then, the radius of the larger circle, $OB$, is equal to $r+2\pi$. Indeed, we know that the length of major arc $\widehat{AD}=2\pi$ and the length of minor arc $\widehat{BC}=2\pi$. So, using the formula for length of an arc formed by the central angle $\angle COB$, which we denote as $\theta$, we have that:

\[\widehat{AD}=2\pi=(2\pi-\theta) \cdot r,\]\[\widehat{BC}=2\pi=\theta \cdot (2\pi+r).\]

Expanding, we have \[\theta \cdot r +2 \pi \theta = 2\pi,\]\[2 \pi r-\theta r=2\pi,\] and by adding the two equations we have that

\[2 \pi \theta + 2 \pi r =4\pi \implies \theta + r=2.\]

Indeed, the question is asking for us to solve for $r$, and so we use $\theta = 2-r$ back into our original equation to solve:

\[(2 \pi - \theta) \cdot r = (2 \pi - 2 +r) \cdot r = (2 \pi -2)r +r^2= 2\pi \implies\]\[r^2+(2 \pi -2)r - 2 \pi =0.\]

Using the quadratic formula, we have that \[r=\frac{2-2\pi \pm \sqrt{(2 \pi -2)^2 - 4(1)(-2\pi)}}{2}=\frac{2-2\pi \pm \sqrt{4 \pi^2 -8 \pi +4+8 \pi}}{2}= \frac{2-2\pi \pm 2 \sqrt{1+ \pi^2}}{2}= 1- \pi \pm \sqrt{1+\pi^2}.\]

Since length must be positive, we consider only the positive root, and so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)} 1 - \pi + \sqrt{1 +\pi^2}}$.
