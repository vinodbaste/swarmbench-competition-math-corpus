## Problem

Points $F$, $G$, and $H$ are collinear with $G$ between $F$ and $H$. The ellipse with foci at $G$ and $H$ is internally tangent to the ellipse with foci at $F$ and $G$, as shown below.

[asy] /* Made by Mathemagician108 */ import graph; unitsize(0.15 inch); draw(ellipse((0,0), 12, 4)); draw(ellipse((8,0), 4, 1.45)); pair F = (-6,0); pair G = (6,0); pair H = (10,0); dot(F^^G^^H); label("$F$", F, 1.5*S, p=fontsize(8pt));  label("$G$", G, 1.5*S, p=fontsize(8pt));  label("$H$", H, 1.5*S, p=fontsize(8pt)); [/asy]

The two ellipses have the same eccentricity $e$, and the ratio of their areas is $2025$. (Recall that the eccentricity of an ellipse is $e = \tfrac{c}{a}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to a focus, and $2a$ is the length of the major axis.) What is $e$?

$\textbf{(A)}~\frac35\qquad\textbf{(B)}~\frac{16}{25}\qquad\textbf{(C)}~\frac45\qquad\textbf{(D)}~\frac{22}{23}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~\frac{44}{45}$

## Solution 1 (Simple)

Let the outer ellipse be ellipse 1, and the inner ellipse be ellipse 2. Let $a_1$, $b_1$, and $c_1$, correspond to the semimajor axis, semiminor axis, and focal distance of ellipse $1$, respectively. Similarly, let $a_2$, $b_2$, and $c_2$ correspond to the semimajor axis, semiminor axis, and focal distance of ellipse $2$, respectively.

Ellipses with the same eccentricity are similar, so $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt{2025} = 45$ because the ratio of semimajor axes between similar ellipses is equal to the square root of the ratio between their areas. Notice how \[a_1 = c_1 + c_2 + a_2.\] Substituting from the eccentricity equation, \[a_1 = ea_1 + ea_2 + a_2.\] Rearranging gives us \[a_1 - ea_1 = ea_2 + a_2\]\[a_1(1-e) = a_2(1+e)\]\[\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{1+e}{1-e} = 45.\] Solving for $e$ then yields $\boxed{\text{(D) }\dfrac{22}{23}}.$

Let $A$ and $B$ be the centers of the ellipses with foci $F, G$ and foci $G, H$ respectively. Then, say $AQ=p$, $AP = q$, $BS=r$, and $BR=s$. Through area formula of ellipse ($ab\pi$, where $a$ is half the major axis and $b$ is half the minor axis), the area of the ellipse with center at $A$ is $\pi pq$ and with center at $B$ is $\pi rs$. Then, we have $\frac{\pi pq}{\pi rs} = 2025$, in which $\frac{pq}{rs} = 2025$.

Additionally, when two ellipses have the same eccentricity, that essentially means the ellipses are stretched the same amount. Therefore, $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{r}{s}$, in which $ps = qr$, and $p=\frac{qr}{s}$.

From the previous equation $\frac{pq}{rs}=2025$, we have $pq=2025rs$, in which $\frac{q^2r}{s} = 2025rs$, in which $q^2r = 2025rs^2$, in which $q^2 = 2025s^2$, and $q=45s$ ( $\neg -45$ as length cannot be negative). Similarly, $p = 45r$.

Connect $F$ to $P$ and $G$ to $R$. We form two similar triangles $PAF$ and $RBG$ (through ASA). We just need to determine the length $BG$, and the problem is solved. Notice that $\frac{RB}{PA} = \frac{BG}{AF}$. because $RB:PA = 45:1$, $BG:AF = 1:45$, and if $AF = 45x$, $BG = x$. To solve for $x$, we connect $B$ to the tangency point of both ellipses ($W$). Then, $AW = 45r$ and $BW = r$, so $AB=44r$. We found that $AF = 45x$, and through definition of foci, $AG = 45x$. $GB = x$, so $AB=46x$. However, $AB = 44r$, so $46x=44r$, $x = \frac{22r}{23}$.

The length of the major axis is $2r$, and because eccentricity is $\frac{c}{a}$, where in our case, $c=x$ and $a=r$, we have $\frac{22r}{23r}$, or $\boxed{\frac{22}{23}}.$

## Solution 2

We label the outer ellipse as Ellipse $1$ and the inner ellipse as Ellipse $2$. Let the focal distance of Ellipse $1$ be $2c_1$ and the major axis be $2a_1$. Similarly, Ellipse $2$ has a focal distance of $2c_2$ and a major axis of $2a_2$.

We label the rightmost vertex of both ellipses as $I$. Because $I$ lies on Ellipse $1$, the sum of the lengths of $FI$ and $GI$ equals $2a_1$. The length of $FI$ can be written as $c_2+a_2+2c_1$, and the length of $GI$ can be written as $c_2+a_2$. Therefore, \[(c_2+a_2+2c_1) + (c_2+a_2) = 2a_1\]\[2c_2+2a_2+2c_1 = 2a_1\]\[c_2+a_2+c_1=a_1.\] Substituting $a_1 = c_1/e$ and $a_2 = c_2/e$, we get \[c_2 + \frac{c_2}{e} + c_1=\frac{c_1}{e}\]\[c_2e + c_2 + c_1e = c_1\]\[c_2(e+1) = c_1(1-e)\]\[\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{1+e}{1-e}\] We now take into account the information regarding the ratio of the ellipses' areas. Because the area of an ellipse with semi-major axis $2a$ and eccentricity $e$ can be written as $\pi a^2\sqrt{1-e^2}$, we get that: \[\frac{\text{Area}_1}{{\text{Area}_2}} = \frac{a_1^2\sqrt{1-e^2}}{a_2^2\sqrt{1-e^2}} = \frac{a_1^2}{a_2^2} = 2025.\]

Therefore, $\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 45$. Because $a_1 = c_1/e$ and $a_2 = c_2/e$, then $\frac{c_1/e}{c_2/e} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}=45$ as well.

Substituting this into the equation found earlier, we get that \[\frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{1+e}{1-e} = 45\]\[1+e = 45-45e\]\[46e = 44\]\[e = \boxed{\frac{22}{23}}.\]

## Solution 3 (No area formulas!)

In the larger ellipse, let $a$ be half the major axis (also called the semi-major axis) and $b$ be half the minor axis (also called the semi-minor axis), and $c$ be the distance between its center and a focus. Since we are given that $2025 = 45^2$ is the ratio of the areas of the two ellipses, it follows that the linear scale factor of the two is $45:1$. Therefore, the semi-major axis of the smaller ellipse is $\frac{1}{45}a$ and its semi-minor axis is $\frac{1}{45}b$. Furthermore, the distance between a focus of the smaller ellipse and its center is $\frac{1}{45}c$. There are now two ways to express the length of the major axis of the large ellipse: $2a$ and $a + c + \frac{1}{45}c + \frac{1}{45}a$. Setting these equal, we now have an expression of degree 1 entirely in terms of $a$ and $c$. Some algebra gives us:

\[a-\frac{1}{45}a=c+\frac{1}{45}c\]

\[\frac{44}{45}a=\frac{46}{45}c\]

\[44a=46c\]

\[e=\frac{c}{a}=\boxed{\text{(D) }\dfrac{22}{23}}\].

Note that this method did not require you to know the area formula of an ellipse (which, incidentally, is $\pi a b$).

## Solution 4 (Similarity)

Parametrize the bigger ellipse with $a,c$ as defined in the problem, and the smaller ellipse with $a',c'$. Note that the ellipses have the same eccentricity, so they are similar with ratio $k^2=2025$ or $k=45$. We wish to find $e=\frac{c}{a}=\frac{c'}{a'}$.

Looking at the figure, we can decompose the semi-major axis $a$ of the bigger ellipse as \[a=c+c'+a'\] Using $c=kc'=45c'$ and $a=45a'$ and rearranging gives us: \[45a'-a'=44a'=45c'+c'=46c'\] Thus $e=\frac{c'}{a'}=\frac{44}{46}=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~\frac{22}{23}}.$
