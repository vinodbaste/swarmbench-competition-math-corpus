## Problem

How many real numbers satisfy the equation $\sin(20\pi x) = \log_{20}(x)$?

$\textbf{(A) } 199 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 200 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 398 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 399 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 400$

## Note

This problem's solution logic is basically the same as [1991 AIME Q4](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=1991_AIME_Problems/Problem_4).

## Solution 1

Let $f(x)=\sin(20\pi x)$ and $g(x)=\log_{20}(x)$. Note that $g$ passes through $\left(\frac{1}{20},-1\right)$ and $(1,0)$ and $(20,1)$; these are the extrema and midpoint of $f$. We want to find the number of intersections of $f$ and $g$.

Let an occurrence of sine passing under the $x$-axis a _down-dip_, and similarly define an _up-dip_. We find that the period of $f$ is $\frac{1}{10}$, so between $x=\frac{1}{20}$ and $x=1$ the number of periods is $9.5$. The first period indeed counts, so effectively we have $10$ down-dips in this interval. Each down-dip contributes $2$ to the total, so we have $20$ total intersections.

From $x=1$ to $x=20$, there are $190$ periods, each of which also contributes $2$ to the total due to the up-dips. Therefore, this case contributes $380$ points to the total.

But $(1,0)$ is counted in both cases, so the total is $20+380-1=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 399}$.

## Solution 2 (AoPS Precalculus)

Note that the number of solutions to $\sin(20\pi x) = \log_{20}(x)$ is the same as asking the number of intersection points of the graphs $\sin(20\pi x)$ and $\log_{20}(x)$.

We begin by understanding the range of $\sin(20\pi x)$. The range is just $-1 \le \sin(20\pi x) \le 1$.

For the graph $\log_{20}(x)$ to intersect $\sin(20\pi x)$, we need $\log_{20}(x)$ to also be in the range $-1 \le \log_{20}(x) \le 1$, which is simplified into $\frac{1}{20} \le x \le 20$.

The period of $\sin(20\pi x)$ is $\frac{2\pi}{20\pi} = \frac{1}{10}$. Thus in every 1 unit, there are 10 periods.

Also, the x intersections of both graphs are the same. $\sin(20\pi x) = 0$ indicates $x = \frac{1}{2} + k$. Also, $\log_{20}(x) = 0$ if $x = 1$, so we have $k = 0$ and we must consider two cases, either $\frac{1}{20} \le x \le 1$ and $1 < x \le 20$.

Case 1: $\frac{1}{20} \le x \le 1$.

For this case, we first must understand one thing. Does $\log_{20}(x)$ intersect the first time $\sin(20\pi x)$ dips below the x-axis for $x \ge 0$ 0 times, 1 time, or 2 times?

Well, notice that if we plug in $x = \frac{1}{20}$, $\sin(20\pi x) = 0$ and $\log_{20}(x) = -1$, so because $\log_{20}(x)$ is increasing, it will intersect the graph of $\sin(20\pi x)$ twice.

Taking this into consideration, in each period, half the period is positive whereas the other half is negative. Then, because there are 10 periods between $\frac{1}{20} \le x \le 1$, there will be 10 negative periods.

Then, the graph $\log_{20}(x)$ intersects these 10 periods twice, giving us a total of 20 intersections in this case.

Case 2: $1 < x \le 20$.

For this case, we see that there is a total of 10 periods per unit, and there are $20 - 1 = 19$ units. Then, because once again there are 10 positive intervals, $\log_{20}(x)$ will intersect each interval twice, giving us a total of 20 intersections per one unit. Multiplying by 19, we get a total of $19 \times 20 = 380$ intersections. However, we have excluded 1, and the first period lasting $1 \le x \le \frac{11}{10}$, we see that two intersections occur, one at the point (1,0) and another at some random point. We already considered the point (1,0) last case, so we subtract 1 from the total to obtain $380 - 1 = 379$.

Thus the total number of solutions to the equation is $20 + 379 =$$\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 399}$.

## Solution 3 (quick but risky)

Each period of the sin function is $\frac{1}{10}$, so 200 periods, 2 intersections each (just draw it out) - 400. But there is 1 overlap in two periods at $(1,0)$, so subtract 1 -> 399 (can check end behavior if time) ~ScoutViolet

## Solution 4 (Unit-period parametrization)

Note that $-1\le \sin 20\pi x=\log_{20} x\le 1$, forcing $\frac{1}{20}\le x\le 20$. For simplicity, let $2\pi t=20\pi x$ or $t=10x\in\left[ \frac{1}{2},200 \right]$. Since $2\pi t$ is the unit-period parametrization, there are $200$ full periods on $[0,200]$, and we check the closed intervals $\left[ \frac{1}{2},1 \right],[1,2],\dots,[199,200]$. By sketching the graph, we see that when sine and log share the same sign, the sine will weave through the log twice for the non-degenerate case. The endpoints are also non-degenerate after verifying $\log\left( \frac{1}{20} \right)=-1,\log_{20}20=1$ whereas $\sin 20\pi \left( \frac{1}{20} \right)=\sin 20\pi(200)=0$.

Because $\log_{20}(x=1)=0=\log_{20}(t=10)$ lands perfectly on an integer, by the intermediate value theorem, $\log$ will only have at most two signs among $-,0,+$ in each full period closed interval. We count $200\cdot 2=400$ intersections. However, $t=10$ is shared among $[9,10]$ and $[10,11]$ so we must subtract the overlap to get $400-1=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 399}$.

## Solution 5 (Risky)

We know that the period of $\sin(20\pi x)$ is $\frac{2\pi}{20\pi}=\frac{1}{10}$, and that the amplitude of the graph is 1. Now, we need to find the values of x for which the graph of $y=\log_{20} x$ intersects with the upper and lower extrema of $\sin(20\pi x)$, or with $y=1$ and $y=-1$. At $y=-1$, $x=20^{-1}=\frac{1}{20}$, and at $y=1$, $x=20^1=20$. We know that for each period of the sin graph, there will be 2 intersections, and there are $\frac{20}{\frac{1}{10}}=200$ periods of the sin graph from 0 to 20. Because there are 3 answer choices close to 400, we can test with smaller bounds using a line, and count the points. The line from $(\frac{1}{20},-1)$ to $(\frac{1}{2},1)$ intersected the graph $y=\sin(20\pi x)$ 9 times, and there were 5 periods between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $0$, thus we can say the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 399}$
