## Problem

Jerry wrote down the ones digit of each of the first $2025$ positive squares: $1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 6, \dots$. What is the sum of all the numbers Jerry wrote down?

$\textbf{(A)}~9025 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~9070 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~9090 \qquad \textbf{(D)}~9115 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~9160$

## Solution 1

By a modulo $10$ argument, the ones digits repeat with period $10$ in the following order: \[1,4,9,6,5,6,9,4,1,0\] The sum of the numbers can be verified to be $45$.

There are $202$ periods that occur from $1$ to $2025$, and there are five extra numbers, those being $1,4,9,6,5$, corresponding to $2021,2022,2023,2024,2025$. The sum of these numbers is $25$.

Hence, the total is \[202\cdot 45+25=9090+25=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~9115}\]

## Solution 2 (Slightly more rigorous than Solution 1, but same idea)

Let $x\equiv n\quad\textrm{(mod 10)}$. We have $x^2\equiv n^2\quad\textrm{(mod 10)}$. So, the numbers must repeat in patterns of $10$. Listing them out gives: \[1,4,9,6,5,6,9,4,1,0.\]These numbers sum to $45$, so the sum of the first $2020$ numbers is $45\cdot202=9090$. Since we need $5$ more numbers, we add $1+4+9+6+5=25$ to our answer to get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~9115}$.

## Solution 3 (Similar to the other solutions but without the use of mods)

The ones digit of a square number is determined by the ones digit of the base. We can find the pattern by looking at the ones digits of the first ten positive squares:

The sequence of ones digits is:

$1$, $4$, $9$, $6$, $5$, $6$, $9$, $4$, $1$, $0$

This pattern of ten digits repeats for every subsequent group of ten squares (e.g., has the same ones digit as , as , etc.).

$1$ + $4$ + $9$ + $6$ + $5$ + $6$ + $9$ + $4$ + $1$ + $0$ = $45$

We now divide by $10$ as the pattern repeats every $10$ terms: $2025$/$10$ results in $202$ full cycles with a remainder of $5$. The sum of the $202$ full cycles is:

$202$ * $45$ = $9090$

However, we must add back $5$ digits, as we had a remainder of $5$ when we divided $2025$ by $10$. Therefore, the sum of the remaining $5$ digits is:

$1$ + $4$ + $9$ + $6$ + $5$ = $25$

Thus, the total sum is:

$9090$ + $25$ = $9115$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~9115}$.

## Solution 4: Modular Arithmetic; Ultra-Rigorous, Not Recommended

We want the sum of the ones digits of . The normal way is to notice the pattern repeats every 10, but instead we will approach this with more modular arithmetic than any sane person would tolerate.

Let , which extracts the ones digit of . We want

\[S = \sum_{n=1}^{2025} f(n).\]

First observe the basic periodicity result: Since depends only on , we have

\[f(n+10) \equiv f(n) \pmod{10}.\]

We will pretend this is deep.

Now compute all residues and their corresponding :

\[\begin{array}{c c} 0^2 & \equiv 0 \\ 1^2 & \equiv 1 \\ 2^2 & \equiv 4 \\ 3^2 & \equiv 9 \\ 4^2 & \equiv 6 \\ 5^2 & \equiv 5 \\ 6^2 & \equiv 6 \\ 7^2 & \equiv 9 \\ 8^2 & \equiv 4 \\ 9^2 & \equiv 1. \end{array}\]

Instead of immediately summing these, we treat the 10-term sequence as a modular function over the ring . Define the sequence for . We want the sum

\[T = \sum_{k=0}^9 a_k = 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 45.\]

Next, determine how many full cycles of length 10 lie in the first 2025 integers. Compute

\[2025 \mod 10 \equiv 5.\]

Then

\[2025 = 10 \cdot 202 + 5.\]

So we have 202 complete cycles plus 5 extra terms.

Sum contributed by the full cycles:

\[202 \cdot 45.\]

We now compute this entirely modulo 10 even though we need the actual sum. First,

\[202 \equiv 2 \pmod{10}, \quad 45 \equiv 5 \pmod{10},\]

so

\[202 \cdot 45 \equiv 2 \cdot 5 = 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}.\]

This tells us nothing useful, so abandon that and compute normally:

\[202 \cdot 45 = (200 \cdot 45) + (2 \cdot 45) = 9000 + 90 = 9090.\]

Now handle the leftover 5 terms: . Compute again even though we already have it:

\[1^2 \equiv 1, \quad 2^2 \equiv 4, \quad 3^2 \equiv 9, \quad 4^2 \equiv 6, \quad 5^2 \equiv 5.\]

Sum:

\[1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 = 25.\]

The full sum is

\[S = 9090 + 25 = 9115.\]

To unnecessarily verify using modular decomposition, write

\[S \equiv \sum_{n=1}^{2025} n^2 \pmod{10}.\]

We can compute the entire sum of squares formula modulo 10 and compare. Using

\[\sum_{n=1}^N n^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6},\]

take . Reduce everything modulo 10 first:

\[2025 \equiv 5, \quad 2026 \equiv 6, \quad 4051 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}.\]

Now compute

\[5 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 30.\]

Thus

\[\sum_{n=1}^{2025} n^2 \equiv 30 \cdot 6^{-1} \pmod{10}.\]

Compute the inverse of 6 modulo 10. Solve . No such exists because . Therefore this modular-verification method is unusable, so we immediately stop and simply trust the earlier cycle-counting method.

Thus the sum of the ones digits of the first 2025 squares is

\[9115.\]
