## Problem

What is the greatest possible area of the triangle in the complex plane with vertices $2z$, $(1+i)z$, and $(1-i)z$, where $z$ is a complex number satisfying $|4z - 2| = 1$?

$\textbf{(A)}~\frac 14 \qquad \textbf{(B)}~\frac 12 \qquad \textbf{(C)}~\frac{9}{16} \qquad \textbf{(D)}~\frac 34 \qquad \textbf{(E)}~1$

## Solution 1

Because we can factor $z$ from each vertex, the area of the triangle is equal to $|z|^2$ multiplied by the area of the triangle with vertices $2, 1+i, 1-i$.

The vertical side of that triangle has length $2$ and the altitude to that side has length $1$, so the area is $1$. We now just need the maximum possible value of $|z|^2$.

The equation $|4z-2| = 1$ can be rewritten as $|z-1/2| = 1/4$. Therefore, it exists as a circle with radius $1/4$ and center at $(1/2, 0)$ on the complex plane. The maximum possible magnitude of a complex number on this circle occurs with $\frac{3}{4}$, with magnitude $\frac{3}{4}$. We can justify this because the line connecting the origin and the complex number $\frac{3}{4}$ goes through the center of the circle.

Our answer is then $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{9}{16}}.$

## Solution 2

Rewrite the second and the third complex number, we get: $\sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}z$, $\sqrt{2}e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}z$. This means that the other two complex numbers both form a $45^{\circ}$ angle with complex numbers both form $2z$. Also notice that the magnitude of the first complex number is $2|z|$, and the second and third complex numbers both have magnitude $\sqrt{2}|z|$, this means that these three points form an isosceles right triangle. Therefore the area for this triangle is simply just $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}|z|\cdot\sqrt{2}|z|=|z|^{2}$. Now since we have $|4z-2|=1$, we can set \[4z-2=e^{i\theta},\theta\in[0,2\pi)\] Therefore \[z=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{e^{i\theta}}{4}\], \[|z|=\frac{1}{4}|2+e^{i\theta}|=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{5+4\cos\theta}\le\frac{3}{4}\]$\Rightarrow$\[Area\le \boxed{\textbf{(C)} \ \frac{9}{16}}\]
