## Problem

Positive integers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $57x+ 22y = 400$. What is the least possible value of $x+y$?

$\textbf{(A) } 10 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 11 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 13 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 14 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 15$

## Solution 1

Let $x+y = a$. Then we have the equation \[35x + 22a = 400.\] Because the other two terms are divisible by $5$, $22a$ must be divisible by $5$ too. Specifically, $a$ is divisible by $5$. Let $a=5b$ and substitute: \[35x + 110b = 400\]\[7x + 22b = 80.\] After some analysis, we find that if $b=3$, $x = 2$. In fact, this is the only solution with positive integer solutions. Therefore, $a = x+y = 5 \cdot 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }15}$.

## Solution 1.5 (EXTREMELY EASY)

$22y$ will always be even. $57x$ must be even for the sum to be an even $400$, so $x$ is even.

Moreover, $x\leq7$ because $\left\lfloor \frac{400}{57} \right\rfloor = 7$.

So the possible values of $x$ are $2$, $4$, and $6$.

$400 - 57\cdot2 = 286 = 22\cdot13$ works.

$400 - 57\cdot4 = 172$ is not a multiple of 22.

$400 - 57\cdot6 = 58$ is not a multiple of 22.

Thus, $x = 2$ and $y = 13$. $x + y = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }15}$

## Solution 2 (Extended Euclid Algorithm)

We first solve for integers $x$ and $y$ such that $57x+22y=400$. Use the Extended Euclid Algorithm to find that \[x_1 = -5, y_1 = 13.\] We multiply both $x_1$ and $y_1$ by 400. Since we require both $x$ and $y$ to be positive integers, let \[x_k = -5 \cdot 400 + 22k\]\[y_k = 13 \cdot 400 - 57k.\] We can check this method of writing $x_k$ and $y_k$ is valid by substitution into the original equation. Finally, we add $x_k$ and $y_k$, to find \[-5 \cdot 400 + 13 \cdot 400 - 35k.\] We want to minimize this value, and after evaluation we find $3200 - 35k$. Minimizing this value over the positive integers, we find $k = 91$, which yields $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }15}$.

## Solution 3 (Mod 11)

Taking mod $11$, we see that $2x\equiv 4 \pmod{11}\iff x\equiv 2 \pmod{11}$. This forces $x=2$ as bigger numbers make the sum pass $400$, so that $y=\frac{400-2\cdot 57}{22}=\frac{200-57}{11}=\frac{143}{11}=13$. So the answer is $x+y=2+13=\boxed{ \textbf{(E) } 15 }$.
