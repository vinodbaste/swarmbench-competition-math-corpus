## Problem

An analog clock starts at midnight and runs for $2025$ minutes before stopping. What is the tangent of the acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand when the clock stops?

$\textbf{(A) } 0 \qquad \textbf{(B) } \sqrt{2}-1 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 2-\sqrt{2} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 3-\sqrt{2}$

## Solution 1

When divided by $60$, $2025$ yields $33$, with a remainder of $45$. Since $33 \equiv 9 \pmod{24}$, the clock is now at $9:45$.

At this time, the hour is $75\%$ over, so the hour hand is also $75\%$ of the way between $9$ and $10$. There are $360/12 = 30 ^\circ$ degrees between $9$ and $10$, and since the hour hand is $75\%$ of the way, it is $30^\circ \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{45}{2}^\circ$ from the minute hand, which is pointing directly at $9$.

We now just need to find $\tan{(45/2)}$. Let this be $x$. Using the tangent addition formula, we get that \[\tan{45} = \frac{x + x}{1 - x\cdot x}\]\[1 = \frac{2x}{1-x^2}\]\[x^2+2x-1 = 0.\] Using the Quadratic Formula, and knowing $x$ must be positive since $0 < x < 90$, we get $x = \tan{(45/2)}= \boxed{\sqrt{2}-1}$

Note: One could solve this quickly using the *tangent half angle identity*, which is $\tan(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{1+\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$ ~math660

Note: Another interesting way to find the angle between the hands at 9:45 is to use the formula $30h - \frac{11}{2}m$, where $h$ is the hour and $m$ is the minute. In this case, we get the angle is $30 \cdot 9 - \frac{11}{2}(45) = \frac{540-495}{2} = \frac{45}{2}$ as desired. ~lprado

## Solution 2 (Sin-Cos Angle Addition)

The closest multiple of $60$ to $2025$ is $60 \cdot 33 = 1980$. $33$, when divided by $12$, leaves remainder $9$, thus clock depicts hour $9$. $2025 - 1980 = 45$ minutes, so time is $9:45$. An hour has $60$ minutes where $\frac{45}{60} = 0.75$, or $0.75$ past the $9$th hour.

The angle between two successive hours are $\frac{360^{\circ}}{12} = 30^{\circ}$, so $45$ minutes would involve $0.75\cdot 30^{\circ} = 22.5^{\circ}$. Since double $22.5^{\circ}$ is $45^{\circ}$, we can use sine and cosine double angle (or addition) identities:

\[\sin(2 \theta)=\sin(\theta)\cdot\cos(\theta)+\sin(\theta)\cdot\cos(\theta)=2 \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\] and \[\cos(2 \theta)=\cos(\theta)\cdot\cos(\theta)-\sin(\theta)\cdot\sin(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta)\]

Notice by dividing $\cos(2 \theta)$ by $\sin(2 \theta)$, the denominator and numerator cancel a trig function, so we get...

\[\frac{\cos(2 \theta)}{\sin(2 \theta)} = \frac{\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta)}{2 \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}\]\[\frac{2}{\tan(2 \theta)} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} - \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\]

Recall $\theta = 22.5^{\circ}$ and $\tan(45^{\circ}) = 1$...

\[2 = \frac{1}{\tan(22.5^{\circ})} - \tan(22.5^{\circ})\]

Let $x = \tan(22.5^{\circ})$... \[2x = 1 - x^2\]\[x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0\] With the quadratic formula we get: \[x = \frac{-2\pm\sqrt{4+4}}{2}=\pm\sqrt{2} - 1\] For $x>0$ since $0^{\circ}<22.5^{\circ}<90$, thus we obtain $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \sqrt{2}-1}$

## Solution 3 (Root Approximation, no trig angle identities)

Following from solutions 1 and 2, we get the time to be $9:45$ and the angle to be $22.5^{\circ}$.

We know that the angle between the hour and minute hand follows the relationship $22.5^{\circ}<30^{\circ}$ and thus $\tan(22.5^{\circ}) < \tan(30^{\circ})$, where $\tan(30^{\circ}) = \frac{\sin(30^{\circ})}{\cos(30^{\circ})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Thus we can find an answer choice that is less than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. We know that $\textbf{(A)}$ is wrong since $\tan(22.5^{\circ})\ne 0$. The other options involve $\sqrt{2}$ which we can approximate with Babylonian Method: \[x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + \frac{S}{x_n}}{2}\] for $x_{n}$ is the guess for $\sqrt{S}$ and $x_{n+1}$ would be the next approximated guess. As such, $\sqrt{2} \approx \frac{1+\frac{2}{1}}{2} = 1.5$ or if you memorized the value then you can take $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$. For $\sqrt{3}$ the approximation would be $\sqrt{3} \approx \frac{2+\frac{3}{2}}{2} = 1.75$. So, $\tan(30^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{1}{1.75} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.571$. Using these values we can check for the approximations for every answer choice:

\[\textbf{(B) } \sqrt{2}-1 \approx 1.414 - 1 = 0.414\]\[\textbf{(C) } 2-\sqrt{2} \approx 2 - 1.414 = 0.586\]\[\textbf{(D) } \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx \frac{1.414}{2} = 0.707\]\[\textbf{(E) } 3-\sqrt{2} \approx 3 - 1.414 = 1.586\]

As seen above, only $\textbf{(B)}$ satisfies the criteria such that the answer is less than $0.571$ and not equal to $0$. (Even though $\textbf{(C)}$ may seem to work with $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.5$ approximation, we know that geometrically $\tan(22.5^{\circ})$ is noticeably different from $\tan(30^{\circ})$ so such close values won't be correct)

Thus, $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \sqrt{2}-1}$.

## Solution 4 (Very fast)

To start, we need to find out what time of day it is. We know there are $24\cdot60=1440$ minutes in a day,so we only have $2025-1440=585$ minutes that we care about. We see that this is $60$ minutes $9$ times with an extra $45$ minutes tacked on, so the time is $9:45$. Thus, we have the arms in this configuration [asy] import geometry; size(130); draw(circle((0,0), 100)); point A= rotate(67.5) * (100,0); point B= (-100,0); point C= (0,0); point D= (0,100); draw(A--C); draw(B--C); draw((D--C), dashed); markrightangle(B,C,D); markangle(Label("$\small\theta$"), radius=9, A, C, D); [/asy] Then we know that $\theta=\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{\pi}{6}$ so $\theta=\frac{\pi}{8}.$ The problem asks us to only find the tangent of the acute part, $\theta$, so \[\tan\frac{\pi}{8}=\frac{\sin\frac{\pi}{4}}{\cos\frac{\pi}{4}+1}=\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+1}=\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{2}}=\frac{1(1-\sqrt{2})}{(1+\sqrt{2})(1-\sqrt{2})}=\frac{1-\sqrt{2}}{-1}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\sqrt{2}-1}\]
