Let $m$ be a positive integer. A triangulation of a polygon is $m$-balanced if its triangles can be colored with $m$ colors in such a way that the sum of the areas of all triangles of the same color is the same for each of the $m$ colors. Find all positive integers $n$ for which there exists an $m$-balanced triangulation of a regular $n$-gon. Note: A triangulation of a convex polygon $\mathcal{P}$ with $n \geq 3$ sides is any partitioning of $\mathcal{P}$ into $n-2$ triangles by $n-3$ diagonals of $\mathcal{P}$ that do not intersect in the polygon's interior.

## Solution 1

The answer is if and only if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$.

We represent the vertices of the regular $n$-gon using complex numbers. Let $\omega = \exp(2\pi i/n)$ be a primitive $n$-th root of unity, and label the vertices as $1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1}$.

Key Lemma:

The triangle with vertices $\omega^k, \omega^{k+a}, \omega^{k+b}$ has signed area:

\[T(a, b) := \frac{(\omega^a - 1)(\omega^b - 1)(\omega^{-b} - \omega^{-a})}{4i}\]

Proof of Lemma:

We can rotate by $\omega^{-k}$ to assume without loss of generality that $k = 0$. Then we apply the complex shoelace formula to the triangle with vertices $1, \omega^a, \omega^b$:

\[\frac{i}{4} \det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \omega^a & \omega^{-a} & 1 \\ \omega^b & \omega^{-b} & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{i}{4} \det \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \omega^a - 1 & \omega^{-a} - 1 & 1 \\ \omega^b - 1 & \omega^{-b} - 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

which simplifies to the expression for $T(a, b)$ above.

Construction (Sufficiency):

To construct a valid triangulation and coloring when $m$ divides $n$, we draw all the diagonals from vertex 1, and then color the resulting triangles with the $m$ colors in cyclic order.

For example, when $n = 9$ and $m = 3$, we get a coloring with red, green, blue as shown in the image, repeating cyclically.

To prove this works, we fix a residue $r \mod m$ corresponding to one of the colors. Then the total area of triangles with this color is:

\[\sum_{\substack{0 \leq j < n \\ j \equiv r \mod m}} \text{Area}(\omega^0, \omega^j, \omega^{j+1}) = \sum_{\substack{0 \leq j < n \\ j \equiv r \mod m}} T(j, j+1)\]

After algebraic manipulation:

\[= \frac{\omega - 1}{4i} \left(\frac{n}{m}(1 + \omega^{-1}) + \sum_{\substack{0 \leq j < n \\ j \equiv r \mod m}} (\omega^{-1-j} - \omega^j)\right)\]

When $m$ divides $n$, we can show that the inner sum vanishes, and the total area of each color equals:

\[\sum_{\substack{0 \leq j < n \\ j \equiv r \mod m}} \text{Area}(\omega^0, \omega^j, \omega^{j+1}) = \frac{n}{m} \cdot \frac{\omega - \omega^{-1}}{4i}\]

Since the right-hand side does not depend on the residue $r$, this shows all colors have equal area.

Necessity:

To prove that $m$ must divide $n$, we note that if there were a valid triangulation and coloring, the total area of each color would equal:

\[S := \frac{n}{m} \cdot \frac{\omega - \omega^{-1}}{4i}\]

We then prove the following claim:

The number $4i \cdot S$ is not an algebraic integer when $m \nmid n$.

This can be shown using the fact that $K = \mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ is a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\omega]$. We demonstrate that:

\[\omega \cdot 4i \cdot S = \frac{n}{m}\omega^2 - \frac{n}{m}\]

is not an algebraic integer when $m$ doesn't divide $n$ because $\frac{n}{m} \not\in \mathbb{Z}$.

However, for any triangle in our construction, $4i \cdot T(a,b)$ is always an algebraic integer. Since a finite sum of algebraic integers is also an algebraic integer, the sum of expressions of the form $4i \cdot T(a,b)$ can never equal $4i \cdot S$ unless $m$ divides $n$.

We can also show this directly by noting that $T(a,b)$ is always divisible by $\frac{\omega - \omega^{-1}}{4i}$, which means we need $\frac{n}{m}$ to be an algebraic integer. A rational number is an algebraic integer if and only if it's a rational integer, so $\frac{n}{m}$ is an algebraic integer exactly when $m$ divides $n$.

Therefore, a valid triangulation and coloring exists if and only if $m$ is a proper divisor of $n$.
