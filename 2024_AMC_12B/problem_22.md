## Problem

Let $\triangle{ABC}$ be a triangle with integer side lengths and the property that $\angle{B} = 2\angle{A}$. What is the least possible perimeter of such a triangle?

$\textbf{(A) }13 \qquad \textbf{(B) }14 \qquad \textbf{(C) }15 \qquad \textbf{(D) }16 \qquad \textbf{(E) }17 \qquad$

## Solution 1

Let $AB=c$, $BC=a$, $AC=b$. According to the law of sines, \[\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\sin \angle B}{\sin \angle A}=2\cos \angle A\]

According to the law of cosines, \[\cos \angle A=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\]

Hence, \[\frac{b}{a}=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{bc}\]

This simplifies to $b^2=a(a+c)$. We want to find the positive integer solution $(a, b, c)$ to this equation such that $a, b, c$ forms a triangle, and $a+b+c$ is minimized. We proceed by casework on the value of $b$. Remember that $a<a+c$.

Case $1$: $b=1$

Clearly, this case yields no valid solutions.

Case $2$: $b=2$

For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=3$. However, $(1, 2, 3)$ does not form a triangle. Hence this case yields no valid solutions.

Case $3$: $b=3$

For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=8$. However, $(1, 3, 8)$ does not form a triangle. Hence this case yields no valid solutions.

Case $4$: $b=4$

For this case, $a=1$ and $c=15$, or $a=2$ and $c=6$. As one can check, this case also yields no valid solutions

Case $5$: $b=5$

For this case, we must have $a=1$ and $c=24$. There are no valid solutions

Case $6$: $b=6$

For this case, $a=2$ and $c=16$, or $a=4$ and $c=5$, or $a=3$ and $c=9$. The only valid solution for this case is $(4, 6, 5)$, which yields a perimeter of $15$.

When $b\ge 7$, it is easy to see that $a+c>7$. Hence $a+b+c>14$, which means $a+b+c\ge15$. Therefore, the answer is $\fbox{\textbf{(C) }15}$

## Solution 2 (Similar to Solution 1)

Let $\overline{BC}=a$, $\overline{AC}=b$, $\overline{AB}=c$. Extend $C$ to point $D$ on $\overline{AB}$ such that $\angle ACD = \angle CAD$. This means $\triangle CDA$ is isosceles, so $CD=DA$. Since $\angle CDB$ is the exterior angle of $\triangle CDA$, we have \[\angle CDB=m+m=2m=\angle CBD.\] Thus, $\triangle CBD$ is isosceles, so $CB=CD=DA=a.$ Then, draw the altitude of $\triangle CBD$, from $C$ to $\overline{BD}$, and let this point be $H$. Let $BH=HD=x$. Then, by Pythagorean Theorem, Thus, \[a^2-x^2=b^2-(c-x)^2.\] Solving for $x$, we have $x=\frac{a^2-b^2+c^2}{2c}.$ Since $2x=c-a$, we have \[c-a=\frac{a^2-b^2+c^2}{c},\] and simplifying, we get $b^2=a^2+ac.$ Now we can consider cases on what $a$ is. (Note: Although there looks to be quite a few cases, they are just trivial and usually only take up to a few seconds max).

Case $1$: $a=1$.

This means $b^2=c+1$, so the least possible values are $b=2$, $c=3$, but this does not work as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Similarly, $b=3$, $c=8$ also does not satisfy it. Anything larger goes beyond the answer choices, so we stop checking this case.

Case $2$: $a=2$ This means $b^2=2c+4$, so the least possible values for $b$ and $c$ are $b=4$,$c=6$, but this does not satisfy the triangle inequality, and anything larger does not satisfy the answer choices.

Case $3$: $a=3$ This means $b^2=3c+9$, and the least possible value for $b$ is $b=6$, which occurs when $c=9$. Unfortunately, this also does not satisfy the triangle inequality, and similarly, any $b > 6$ means the perimeter will get too big.

Case $4$: $a=4$ This means $b^2=4c+16$, so we have $b=6,c=5,a=4$, so the least possible perimeter so far is $4+5+6=15$.

Case $5$: $a=5$ We have $b^2=5c+25$, so least possible value for $b$ is $b=10$, which already does not work as $a=5$, and the minimum perimeter is $15$ already.

Case $6$: $a=6$ We have $b^2=6c+36$, so $b=10$, which already does not work.

Then, notice that when $a\geq 7$, we also must have $b\geq8$ and $c\geq1$, so $a+b+c \geq 16$, so the least possible perimeter is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}.$

## Solution 3 (Trigonometry)

\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}\]\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(2A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(\pi- 3A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(3A)}\]\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{2\sin(A)\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{3\sin(A) - 4\sin^3(A)}\]\[b = 2\cos(A)a\]\[c = (3 - 4\sin^2(A) ) a = (4\cos^2(A)-1)a\]\[A+B = A+2A < 180^{\circ}\]\[A < 60^{\circ} ,  \frac{1}{2} <  cos(A)  < 1\]

\[a:b:c = 1: 2\cos(A) : 4\cos^2(A)-1\]$\cos(A)$ must be rational, let's evaluate some small values

case #1: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{2}$ invalid since = $\frac{1}{2}$

case #2: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{3}$ invalid since <$\frac{1}{2}$

case #3: $\cos(A) = \frac{2}{3}$ give ${1: \frac{4}{3} :  \frac{7}{9}  }$ with side $9:12:7$ , perimeter = 28

case #4: $\cos(A) = \frac{1}{4}$ invalid since <$\frac{1}{2}$

case #5: $\cos(A) = \frac{3}{4}$ give ${1: \frac{3}{2} :  \frac{5}{4}  }$ with side $4:6:5$, perimeter = 15

case #6: $\cos(A) = \frac{3}{5}$ give ${1: \frac{6}{5} :  \frac{11}{25}  }$ with side $25:30:11$

case #7: $\cos(A) = \frac{4}{5}$ give ${1: \frac{8}{5} :  \frac{39}{25}  }$ with side $25:40:39$

case #8: $\cos(A) = \frac{4}{6}$ same as $\frac{2}{3}$

case #9: $\cos(A) = \frac{5}{6}$ give ${1: \frac{5}{3} :  \frac{16}{9}  }$ with side (9:15:16)

case #10: when $a \geq 7, b =2cos(A)*a > 2*  \frac{1}{2}*7 = 7 , a+b+c > 15$

$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$

## Solution 4

Draw the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABC}$ and let the angle bisector of $\angle{B}$ meet the circle at $D$

By fact 5 we have $CD=AD, \angle{CBD}=\angle{ABD}=\angle{CAB}=\angle{DAC}, \angle{CBA}=\angle{DAB}$, thus $AC=BD, CD=CB$

By Ptolemy, we have $c^2=(a+b)CD, CD=\frac{c^2}{a+b}=a, a^2+ab=c^2$. Try some numbers and the answer is $(4,5,6)\implies \boxed{15}$

## Solution 5

Let $\angle A=\theta$, then $\angle B=2\theta$.

Find $D$ on $AB$ such that $\angle ACD=\theta$. Thus, $\angle CDB=\angle A+\angle ACD=2\theta$. So $AD=CD=BD$.

Find $E$ on $BD$ such that $CE\perp BD$. Apparently, this gives $E$ as the mid-point of $BD$.

Let the length of $BC$ be $x$. Then $AB$ can be expressed as $AD+BD=AD+2BE=x+2x\cos 2\theta$.

Since $CE=x\sin 2\theta$, the length of $AC$ can be expressed as $2x\cos\theta$ (using double angle formula).

Now we need to determine the range of $\theta$.

The above conditions are only valid if $\angle B$ is an acute angle.(the strict proof will be shown in the end*) So $\theta<45^\circ$, this yields $\cos\theta\in\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},1\right)$.

Let $\cos\theta=\frac{p}{q}$, where $(p,q)=1$.

To minimize the perimeter, the denominator needs to be as small as possible. In this way, a small $x$ can be used to integrate the side length.

Test $q=2$, $\frac{1}{2}$ is not in the range.

Test $q=3$, $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$ are not in the range (since $0.67<0.71$).

Test $q=4$, $\frac{3}{4}$ is in the range. In this case, the smallest $x$ that make side length integer is $4$, since the side length is $x$, $\frac{5}{4}x$ and $\frac{3}{2}x$ So the perimeter is $4+5+6=15$.

So $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }15}$ is the correct answer.

When $q$ becomes bigger, a larger $x$ is required to integrate the length, thus cannot give the minimum perimeter.

If $\angle B>90^\circ$, $\angle A+\angle B>135^\circ$,then$\angle C<45^\circ$. This will result in point D on the extension of AB, meaning that $\angle CDB+\angle CBD<180^\circ$. Hence, $2\angle B<180^\circ$,$\angle B<90^\circ$, which contradicts our condition. If $\angle B=90^\circ$,The triangle is isosceles right triangle. So, the ratio of sides is $1:1:\sqrt{2}$, which, obviously means the length cannot be all integers.

## Solution 6

Extend the angle bisector of $\angle B$ to point $P$ on $\overline{AC}.$ We have $\triangle BPC \sim ABC,$ so $\frac{m}{b} = \frac{b}{c},$ yielding $m = \frac{b^2}{c}.$ By the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{m}{n},$ so $\frac{ma}{b} = \frac{ab}{c} = n$ after substitution. We also have $m + n = c,$ so \[\frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{ab}{c} = c \implies b^2 + ab = b(b + a) = c^2,\] for $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}.$ We can't have $b=1$ for any integral triangle. If $b = 2$ then $2a + 4 = c^2$, which gives $c = 4$ and $a = 6,$ which fails the triangle inequality. If $b=3$ then $a = 9$ and $c = 6$, which fails again. If $b = 4$, then $(a, c) = (5, 6)$, which works and yields a perimeter of $15$. If $b=5$, then $(a, c) = (15, 10),$ and if $b = 6$, then $(a, c) = (18, 12),$ which fails again.

If $b \geq 7$ then $a+b>7,$ yielding a minimum perimeter of $\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 15}},$ which was already achieved.

## Solution 7 (No Casework, Trig)

Let $AB=c$, $BC=a$, $AC=b$.

Our goal is to find

\[\min_{a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}} a+b+c\]

By the law of sines,

\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}\]

Substituting $B=2A$ and $C = 180^\circ - A - B$:

\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(2A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(180^\circ-3A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(3A)}\]

We will attempt to cancel the $\sin(A)$ factor in the denominator. Using multiple-angle trigonometric identities,

\[\sin(2A) = 2\sin(A)\cos(A)\]\[\sin(3A) = \sin(A)(4\cos^2(A)-1)\]

we obtain:

\[\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{2\sin(A)\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{\sin(A)(4\cos^2(A)-1))}\]

which simplifies to:

\[a = \frac{b}{2\cos(A)} = \frac{c}{(4\cos^2(A)-1))}\]

We notice that the term $2\cos(A)$ appears multiple times. For convenience, let $t:=2\cos(A)$. Then, rewriting $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$, we get:

\[b=ta\]\[c=(t^2-1)a\]

We now rewrite the original goal in terms of $t$ and $a$. Notice that since $a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}$, then the perimeter $a+b+c \in \mathbb{N}$. Hence,

\[a+b+c = a + ta + (t^2-1)a\]\[= at(t+1) \in \mathbb{N}\]

This means that $t \in \mathbb{Q}$, so let $t := \frac{m}{n}$ with $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. To minimize

\[a+b+c = at(t+1) = a\left(\frac{m^2}{n^2}+\frac{m}{n}\right)\]

we set $a = n^2$ to ensure the perimeter is an integer, and the objective becomes

\[\min_{m,n \in \mathbb{N}} m(m+n)\]

Notice that to have a valid triangle, $c=(t^2-1)a>0$ implies $t^2 - 1 > 0$ so $t > 1$.

In addition, due to the triangle inequality, we must have $c < a + b$, such that

\[(t^2-1)a < a + ta\]

Since $a>0$, we can safely divide through, yielding $t > 2$. Overall, we have $1<t<2$, or equivalently, $n<m<2n$. The smallest pair satisfying this condition is $n=2$, $m=3$, yielding a perimeter of $15$. (Notice, to have a valid integer between $n$ and $2n$, there must be a gap of at least $1$ in between, implying $2n-n-1=n-1\ge 1$, so setting $n=2$ yields the minimum.) Increasing $m$ or $n$ will increase the perimeter, so this is the global minimum. Hence the answer is:

\[\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 15}}\]
