## Problem

The national debt of the United States is on track to reach $5\times10^{13}$ dollars by $2033$. How many digits does this number of dollars have when written as a numeral in base $5$? (The approximation of $\log_{10} 5$ as $0.7$ is sufficient for this problem)

$\textbf{(A) } 18 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 20 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 22 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 24 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 26$

## Solution 1

Generally, the number of digits of number $n$ in base $b$ is \[\lfloor \log_b n \rfloor + 1.\] In this question, it is $\lfloor \log_{5} (5\times 10^{13})\rfloor+1$. Note that \begin{align*} \log_{5} (5\times 10^{13}) &= 1+\frac{13}{\log_{10} 5} \\ &\approx 1+\frac{13}{0.7} \\ &\approx 19.5 \end{align*} Hence, our answer is $\fbox{\textbf{(B)} 20}$

## Solution 2

We see that $5\times 10^{13} = 2^{13} \cdot 5^{14}$ and $2^{13} = 8192$. Converting this to base $5$ gives us $230232$ (trust me it doesn't take that long). So the final number in base $5$ is $230232$ with $14$ zeroes at the end, which gives us $6 + 14 = 20$ digits. So the answer is $\fbox{\textbf{(B)} 20}$.

Note - Base Conversion Step

To convert the number $8192$ from base 10 to base 5, we follow these steps:

1. Divide the number by 5 repeatedly, noting the quotient and remainder each time.

2. Stop when the quotient becomes 0, then read the remainders from bottom to top.

\[8192 \div 5 = 1638 \text{ remainder } 2\]\[1638 \div 5 = 327 \text{ remainder } 3\]\[327 \div 5 = 65 \text{ remainder } 2\]\[65 \div 5 = 13 \text{ remainder } 0\]\[13 \div 5 = 2 \text{ remainder } 3\]\[2 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 2\]

Now, reading the remainders from bottom to top:$2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2$.

Thus, $8192$ in base 5 is:

\[\boxed{230232_5}\] ~[luckuso](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cyantist)

Note - an approximation you can use here to convert 8192 to base 5: since $5^5 = 3125$ and $5^6 = 15625$, we automatically know that you need 6 digits to represent $2^{13}$ in base 5.

## Solution 3

$5 \times 10^{13} = 5 \times (5^{13} \times 2^{13}) = 2^{13} \times 5^{14} = 8192 \times 5^{14}.$

$5^5 = 3125$ and $5^6 = 15625$ (or just notice that it must be $> 8192$) $\implies 5^5 < 8192 < 5^6 \implies 5^{19} < 5 \times 10^{13} < 5^{20}$.

Since an integer $x$ has $n$ base-$a$ digits when it satisfies $a^{n-1} \le x < a^n$, it follows that $5 \times 10^{13}$ requires $\fbox{\textbf{(B)} 20}$ base-5 digits.
