## Problem

The measures of the smallest angles of three different right triangles sum to $90^\circ$. All three triangles have side lengths that are primitive Pythagorean triples. Two of them are $3-4-5$ and $5-12-13$. What is the perimeter of the third triangle?

$\textbf{(A) } 40 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 126 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 154 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 176 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 208$

## Solution 1

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the smallest angles of the $3-4-5$ and $5-12-13$ triangles respectively. We have \[\tan(\alpha)=\frac{3}{4} \text{ and } \tan(\beta)=\frac{5}{12}\] Then \[\tan(\alpha+\beta)=\frac{\frac{3}{4}+\frac{5}{12}}{1-\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{5}{12}}=\frac{56}{33}\] Let $\theta$ be the smallest angle of the third triangle. Consider \[\tan{90^\circ}=\tan((\alpha+\beta)+\theta)=\frac{\frac{56}{33}+\tan{\theta}}{1-\frac{56}{33}\cdot\tan{\theta}}\] In order for this to be undefined, we need \[1-\frac{56}{33}\cdot\tan{\theta}=0\] so \[\tan{\theta}=\frac{33}{56}\] Hence the base side lengths of the third triangle are $33$ and $56$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse of the third triangle is $65$, so the perimeter is $33+56+65=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }154}$.

## Solution 2 (Complex Number)

The smallest angle of $3-4-5$ triangle can be viewed as the arguement of $4+3i$, and the smallest angle of $5-12-13$ triangle can be viewed as the arguement of $12+5i$.

Hence, if we assume the ratio of the two shortest length of the last triangle is $1:k$ ($k$ being some rational number), then we can derive the following formula of the sum of their arguement. Since their arguement adds up to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, it's the arguement of $i$. Hence, \[\left(4+3i\right)\left(12+5i\right)\left(k+i\right)=ni\,,\] where $n$ is some real number.

Solving the equation, we get \[56k-33=0\,,\quad 33k+56=n\,.\] Hence $k=\frac{33}{56}$

Since the sidelength of the theird triangle are co-prime integers, two of its sides are $33$ and $56$. And the last side is $\sqrt{33^2+56^2}=65$, hence, the parameter of the third triangle if $33+56+65=\boxed{\mathbf{(C)}\,154}$.

## Solution 3 (Another Trig)

Denote the smallest angle of the $3-4-5$ triangle as $\alpha$, the smallest angle of the $5-12-13$ triangle as $\beta$, and the smallest angle of the triangle we are trying to solve for as $\theta$. We then have \[\alpha + \beta + \theta = 90\]\[\alpha + \beta = 90 - \theta\]\[\sin{(\alpha + \beta)} = \sin{(90 - \theta)} = \cos{\theta}\]\[\cos{\theta} = \sin{\alpha}\cos{\beta} + \cos{\alpha}\sin{\beta} = (\frac{3}{5})(\frac{12}{13}) + (\frac{4}{5})(\frac{5}{13}) = \frac{56}{65}\] Taking the hypotenuse to be $65$ and one of the legs to be $56$, we compute the last leg to be $\sqrt{65^2 - 56^2} = \sqrt{(65-56)(65+56)} = \sqrt{9*121} = 3*11 = 33$

Giving us a final answer of $65 + 56 + 33 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }154}$.

### Solution 3.1 (Different Flavor of the same thing)

Consider $\sin(\theta) = \sin(90 - (\alpha + \beta)) = \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{33}{65}$ using the cosine addition identity. Instead of using the Pythagorean theorem, we can use Euclid's formula since we're dealing with primitive triples.

\[65 = a^2 + b^2\]\[33 = a^2 - b^2\]

Combining that, we get $a = 7$ and $b=4$. Using this, we can get that the other leg must be $2ab = 56$. We add the lengths and get that the perimeter is $56 + 65 + 33 = \boxed{154}$.

## Solution 4 (Similarity)

[](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=File:Pithagor_triangles_13_5_65.png)

Let's arrange the triangles $BCD (5-12-13), BCE (9-12-15)$ and $ABE$ as shown in the diagram. \[F = AE \cap BC.\]\[AE \perp AB, DB \perp AB \implies \triangle BCD \sim \triangle FCE \sim \triangle FAB \implies\]\[EF = \frac{9 \cdot 13}{5}, CF = \frac{9 \cdot 12}{5}, BF = BC + CF = \frac{12 \cdot 14}{5},\]\[\frac {AB}{CE} = \frac {BF}{EF} \implies AB =  \frac{12 \cdot 14}{13},\]\[AE = AF - EF = BF \cdot \frac {12}{13} - EF = \frac {99}{13} \implies\]\[AE : AB : BE = 99 : 12 \cdot 14 : 15 \cdot 13 = 33 : 56 : 65 \implies 65 + 56 + 33 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }154}\]**vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss**

## Solution 5 (Complex)

Suppose the triangle has legs $a, b$. We want \[\arctan \frac{3}{4} + \arctan\frac{5}{12} + \arctan\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\pi}{2}.\] This is equivalent to \begin{align*}     \arg{e^{i\arctan\frac{3}{4}}\cdot e^{i\arctan\frac{5}{12}}\cdot e^{i\arctan\frac{a}{b}}} &= \frac{\pi}{2}\\     \arg(4+3i)(12+5i)(b+ai) &= \frac{\pi}{2}\\      \arg\left( (33b -56a)+(33a + 56b)i\right) &= \frac{\pi}{2} \end{align*} Since the argument of this complex number is $\frac{\pi}{2},$ its real part must be $0$. Matching real and imaginary parts yields $33b = 56a,$ or $b = \frac{56}{33}a$. The smallest pair $(a, b)$ that works is $(33, 56),$ which yields a hypotenuse of $65.$ The perimeter of this triangle is $33 + 56 + 65 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 154}}.$

## Solution 6 (Law of Cosines)

We can start by scaling the $3-4-5$ right triangle up by a factor of $3$ and "gluing" it to the $5-12-13$ triangle's longer leg. Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\theta$ be the smallest angles in the $3-4-5$, $5-12-13$ and unknown triangle respectively. We can construct the following diagram of the two known triangles. [asy] pair A = (0,0); pair B = (5,0); pair C = (14,0); pair D = (5,12);  draw(A--C--D--cycle); draw(B--D);  draw(rightanglemark(A,B,D,20));  label("5", A--B, S); label("9", B--C, S); label("15", C--D, NE); label("13", D--A, NW); label("12", B--D, E);  label("$\beta$", D, 6*dir(257)); label("$\alpha$", D, 4*dir(287)); [/asy]

We can also construct a diagram for the third, unknown triangle like so. We know that $\alpha+\beta+\theta=90$, and therefore that $\theta=90-\alpha-\beta$. We also know that the other acute angle in this third triangle will have a measure of $\alpha+\beta$ by the triangle angle sum theorem. [asy] pair A = (0,0); pair B = (56,0); pair C = (56,33);  draw(A--B--C--cycle);  draw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,50));  label("$90-\alpha-\beta$", A, 8*dir(12)); label("$\alpha+\beta$", C, 6*dir(242)); [/asy] We can use the law of cosines on the triangle in the first diagram to get the equation $14^2=15^2+13^2-2(13)(15)\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}$. Isolating $\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}$, we get $-198=-390\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}$, which further simplifies to $\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{198}{390}$. Since the third triangle has to be a primitive Pythagorean triple, we must take this trig ratio into its most simple form, namely $\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}=\frac{33}{65}$. Using this information in our second diagram, we know that the smaller, adjacent leg must have length $33$, and the hypotenuse must have length $65$. We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other, unknown leg, which has length $56$. Adding these three lengths together, we find that the perimeter of this right triangle is $33+56+65=\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 154}}$.

### Solution 6.1 (Faster Ending)

Instead of computing $\sqrt{65^2-33^2}$ to find the second leg in the unknown triangle by hand, we can use process of elimination. $\textbf{(B)}\ 126$ and $\textbf{(C)}\ 154$ are the only answers within the realm of possibility, because $\textbf{(A)}\ 40$ would entitle a triangle with a negative side length, and $\textbf{(D)}\ 176$ and $\textbf{(E)}\ 208$ would require legs greater than the length of the hypotenuse. The answer choice $\textbf{(B)}\ 126$ would force the second leg to have a length of $28$, which is smaller than the smallest leg in the triangle. (We know that the leg with length $33$ is the smallest leg in the triangle by the side-angle relationship theorem, because it is opposite the smallest angle in the triangle.) Therefore, the only valid answer choice remaining is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 154}}$.

## Solution 7 (No Trig, Coord Bash)

Set up a coordinate system. Let ](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=File:AMC_12B_2024_Problem_21_Triangles.png)

Now the $3-4-5$ and $5-12-13$ triangles describe the vectors $\langle 3, 4 \rangle$ and $\langle 12, 5 \rangle$ with the smallest angle of the third triangle, $\theta$, between them. We can find $cos(\theta)$ by taking the dot product and dividing by the magnitudes of the vectors (which are the hypotenuses that we know to be 5 and 13).

\begin{align*}     \cos \theta = \frac{\langle 3, 4 \rangle \cdot \langle 12, 5 \rangle}{\|\langle 3, 4 \rangle\| \, \|\langle 12, 5 \rangle\|} = \frac{3 \cdot 12 + 4 \cdot 5}{5 \cdot 13} = \frac{56}{65} \end{align*}

This ratio $\cos \theta = \frac{56}{65}$ describes the third triangle to have a hypotenuse with length $65$, one leg with length $56$, and another leg with length $\sqrt{65^2 - 56^2} = \sqrt{(65 - 56)(65 + 56)} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 121} = 33$ by Pythagorean and difference of squares.

The perimeter is then $65 + 56 + 33 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)\ 154}}$
